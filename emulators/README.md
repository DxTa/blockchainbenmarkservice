# Emulators

Emulators are used to benchmark and test blockchain operations together with other features in the application context. The principle is that the developer knows possible interactions that they should develop so they can write some simple emulators for benchmarks.

## Current emulators

* v2x communicator: emulators for vehicle communication


## Developing new emulators

You can develop a new emulators for testing interactions you want with other blockchain systems.

TODO: we will write some guidelines here.
